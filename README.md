## üñ•Ô∏è Starting development

Starting the server-side for development and APIs query

```
npm run server
```

Starting the client-side for development

```
npm run dev
```

## Production

Both the backend and frontend server has to be deployed for the app to work as expected. Presently, the client is being served by https://smartfolio-7gt75z5x3q-as.a.run.app.

### 1. Server Deployment

Due to complexities of deployment of a mixed language architecture, the backend is containerized and deployed on Google Cloud Run. An extensive user guide on Docker and GCR deployment can be found here
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/02_our_app/

To deploy on GCR via Docker images

```
gcloud run deploy your-service-name --image gcr.io/your-project-id/your-image-name:your-tag --platform managed
```

### 2. Client Deployment

```
npm run build
firebase deploy
```
